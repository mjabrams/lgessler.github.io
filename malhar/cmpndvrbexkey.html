<center>Key to exercise on compound verbs and their meanings. </center>
<br />

 la. The compound form बैठ जाइए gives a more peremptory tone to a command addressed
to a stranger.   See discussion of example (16) in </a><a href="cmpndvrb.html#016">Notes</a> <br />

 lb. The non-compound form बैठिए is appropriate when addressing an older relative 
who is perfectly willing to co-operate. <br />

 2a.The non-compound form की is much to be preferred since Columbus's discovery 
of what we have come to know as &quot;America&quot; was unforeseen (and unforeseeable) at the time.  
Columbus, believing he had reached Asia, did not know that he had discovered a new continent. 
 See discussion of examples (4) and (5) in <a href="cmpndvrb.html#003">Notes</a>
<br />

 2b.The compound form कर ली because the statement contrasts Leif Ericson's 
discovery of America as occurring <b>before</b> Columbus's 
discovery of it.  See discussion of examples (9) and (10) in 
<a href="cmpndvrb.html#009">Notes</a><br />

 3a.The compound form कर लेते is appropriate because the second clause 
introduces an activity that is an exception to that in the first clause.   
See discussion of example (14) in <a href="cmpndvrb.html#010">Notes</a> <br />

 3b.  The writer does not present Kabir's occupation [he was a weaver in Varanasi] 
as being a departure from his writing poetry. The activities of working and writing were 
both normal parts of his life.  For this reason the non-compound form करते is to be preferred 
to the compound  कर लेते. <br />

 4a. The host guesses that his guests will arrive after 2:30 o'clock  so the compound form 
पहुँचेंगे is appropriate.   See discussion of example (11)  in the <a href="cmpndvrb.html#009">
Notes</a> <br />

 4b. The speaker claims that the guests will arrive before 8 or 9 o'clock has struck 
so the compound form पहुँच जाएँगे is appropriate.   See discussion of examples (9) and (10) 
in the <a href="cmpndvrb.html#009">Notes</a> <br /> 

 5a.  Use of a compound verb in the past tense implies successful completion of the action 
it refers to.  Thus only the non-compound form खोला is possible when the following clause negates it. 
 See discussion of example (6) in the <a href="cmpndvrb.html#004">Notes</a> 
<br />

 5b. Roopchand's action of opening the door precedes his visitors' knocking on it. 
Hence the compound form  खोल दिया is appropriate.   See discussion of examples (9) and (10) 
in the <a href="cmpndvrb.html#009">Notes</a> <br />

 6a.  By paying a tonga driver to take him there the writer arrives easily at his destination.  
In such a situation the compound form पहुँच गया is felicitous (although the non-compound is also 
possible).  See discussion of examples (12) and (13) in the <a href="cmpndvrb.html#012">Notes</a> 
<br />

 6b. Traveling via a mountain road the writer has had trouble getting to where 
he wanted to go so the non-compound form पहुँचा is more likely than the compound पहुँच गया. <br />

 7a. The first clause &quot;sets up&quot; the event in the second clause as a salient result of the explosion. 
 See example (7) in the <a href="cmpndvrb.html#007">Notes</a> <br />

 7b. The main point of this part of the report is that no-one was in the room at the time the roof fell, 
hence the non-compound form गिरी is more likely than the compound गिर गई.  Generally speaking, 
position inside a relative clause decreases the likelihood that a verb will occur in compound form. <br />  


<!-- &nbsp;2a. &nbsp;<FONT FACE="Xdvng">j:l: g:y:&#240;</font>, since the
effect of the action on the victims is exhaustive. (They have died as a
result of the fire.) <br>

&nbsp;2b. &nbsp;<FONT FACE="Xdvng">j:l:a </font> because the
action of the fire on the speaker is presented (&nbsp;by the use of
&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Xdvng">es:f&#252;</font> . . .&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Xdvng">
j:l:a</font>&nbsp;) as limited in scope. <br/>

(from here on the key is still under revision) <br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3a: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"
FACE="Xdvng"> p:`a </font> . The speaker is inviting the addressee to read
in the Ramayana rather than through it. 3b: &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"
FACE="Xdvng"> p:` el:y:a </font>. Here note that V - &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"
FACE="Xdvng"> n:&#240; s:&#240; p:hl:&#240; </font> and &nbsp;<FONT
SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> p:&#220;ra </font> are promoting the compound
form. <br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4a: &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> c:a&#240;ri h&#216;I </font> would be
normal unless the speaker was waiting to be robbed. 4b: &nbsp;<FONT
SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> c:a&#240;ri ha&#240; g:I </font> agrees with the
irony of &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> AaeQ:r </font> . <br/> 

&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5a: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"
FACE="Xdvng"> kXa el:y:&#240; </font> with &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"
FACE="Xdvng"> AaeQ:r </font> suggests a prior period of resistance. 5b:
&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> kXaO </font> subsumes the haircut
under the larger act of barbering which was rounded off with a shampoo.
<br/> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6a: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<FONT
SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> Ap:n:&#240; p:as: rK: l:a&#240; </font> suggests
forethought and anticipation of accidents. 6b: &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"
FACE="Xdvng">rK:a&#240; </font> is appropriate to action without visible
effect ( cf. &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> p:&#224;Tv:i c:a&#248;d
ka&#240; Ap:n:i Aa&#240;r K:i&#248;c:t:i h&#242; .</font> ) . <br/> 

&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7a: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"
FACE="Xdvng">p:k_a </font> is better, especially if grabbing the hand is
seen as subsidiary part of the act of walking together. 7b: &nbsp;<FONT
SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> p:k_ el:y:a </font> brings out the anticipation of
escape and the fear of getting caught. <br/> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 8a: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> K:aAa&#240;
</font> because eating the candy is presented as good in itself. 8b:
&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> K:a l:a&#240; </font> here because
eating the candy is seen as a means to some ends. <br/>

 &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9a: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng">
edK:aI d&#240; g:y:&#240;  </font> , especially if the kite spots him in
spite of the rabbit's efforts to stay out of sight. 9b: &nbsp;<FONT
SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> edK:aI di&#248; </font> , since the flames are in
plain sight of the former house-owners. <br/> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 10a: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> d&#240;t:i
h&#242; </font>. The speaker is taking pleasure in the fact itself. 10b:
&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> d&#240; d&#240;t:i h&#242; </font> ,
in contrast, suggests the speaker's feelings of frustration. <br/>

--->

<!-- &nbsp;13a. &nbsp;<FONT FACE="Xdvng">ha&#240; g:y:a</font>, since
the prior clause indicates that the speaker (and hearer) had been
expecting what happened to happen.  See <FONT
FACE="Xdvng">)&#240;m:c:nd</font>'s short story <FONT
FACE="Xdvng">t:&#240;&#248;t:r</font>, second page, line 16. <br/> -->

<!-- &nbsp;13b. &nbsp;<FONT FACE="Xdvng">h&#216;Aa </font> because the
presence of &nbsp;<FONT FACE="Xdvng">hi</font>&nbsp; as a
delimiting particle (incorporated in &nbsp;<FONT
FACE="Xdvng">v:hi</font>&nbsp;) tends to suppress the use of a
compound verb, even when other factors (such as the expression of
fear) favor it. See <FONT FACE="Xdvng">)&#240;m:c:nd</font>'s
short story <FONT FACE="Xdvng">t:&#240;&#248;t:r</font>, first
line of first page.  <br/> -->
