<font color="white">....<font color="black">One of the striking peculiarities
of Kashmiri (besides being V-2 in its word order) is the existence in it
of classes of expressions of natural forces and natural processes that use
two-place predicates for the expression of events which, in most
languages, are expressed with one-place predicates.  In exx (1) and (2)
<i> kar </i> 'do' and <i> kaD </i> 'draw' have predicate argument
structures which normally are satisfied by two core NPs.  (The dative NPs
are optional adjuncts):  <br />

	(1) vuzimali karyi-n (asmaan-as) <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black">strokes.fpl did.fpl-3sgErg sky-Dat
<br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> 'There was lightning (in the
sky).' <br />

	(2) taarakh keDyi-n (nab-as)  neny <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> stars.mpl drew.mpl-3sgErg sky-Dat
clear.mpl <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> 'The stars came out bright (in
the sky).' <br />

The lexically two-place predicates in (1) and (2) alternate with one-place
predicates: <br />

	(3) vuzimali geyi (asmaan-as) <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> strokes.fpl went.fpl sky-Dat <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> 'There was lightning (in the
sky).' <br />

	(4) taarakh draayi (nab-as)  neny <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> stars.mpl came.out.mpl sky-Dat
clear.mpl <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> 'The stars came out bright (in
the sky).' <br />

We are unable to discover the semantic (or pragmatic) conditions which
govern the choice between (1) and (3) or between (2) and (4). <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black">The presence of only one core NP
in association with the lexically two-place predicates when they figure in
expressions of natural forces and processes leaves an empty slot which (in
preterite and perfect tenses) is filled with a dummy subject represented
by the third person suffix <i> -n. </i> Notice that the suffix in exx (1)
and (2) is singular while the overt core noun is plural.  Furthermore,
without the suffix <i> -n </i> (1) and (2) are not grammatical: <br />

	(5) *vuzimali karyi (asmaan-as)  [compare (1)] <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> strokes.fpl did.fpl sky-Dat <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> 'There was lightning (in the
sky).' <br />

	(6) *taarakh keDyi (nab-as) neny [compare (2)] <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> stars.mpl drew.mpl sky-Dat
clear.mpl <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> 'The stars came out bright (in
the sky).' <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black">Whether speakers use a two-place
predicate as in exx (1)  and (2) or the corresponding one-place predicate
as in exx (3) and (4)  there is only one core noun phrase that is
referential.  That is, in exx (1) and (2) the ergative third person
singular pronominal suffix (which in general represents an agent-subject)
has no referent, at least not in the modern language.  It is tempting to
suppose that at some time in the past it was possible to use an overt noun
phrase referring to some supernatural being instead of the ergative
suffix.  However, speakers today do not accept such alternatives as part
of the living language.  That is, while (7) and (8) are grammatical,
no-one would use them: <br />

	(7) vuzimali karyi (asmaan-as) khwadaay-an [compare (1)] <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> strokes.fpl did.fpl sky-Dat
God-Erg <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> 'God made lightning (in the
sky).' <br />

	(8) taarakh keDyi (nab-as) neny khwaday-an [compare (2)] <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> stars.mpl drew.mpl sky-Dat
clear.mpl God-Erg <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> 'God brought the stars out bright
(in the sky).' <br />
 
<font color="white">....<font color="black">The question we address in this
paper is this: What is the grammatical status of the null element in (1)
and (2)?  Is it a subject?  Does it have a grammatical function?  Can it
get case?  Or does it simply satisfy some morphological requirement of
two-place predicates in the preterite or perfect? <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black">The answer to these questions is
quite surprising: Careful syntactic analysis reveals that there are two
classes of such predicates.  In one class the third person singular marker
is indeed a kind of morpho-logical filler with no syntactic status.  Even
though the predicates in this class are lexically two-place (or
transitive), they behave in their syntax quite like one-place
(intransitive) predicates.  The null subject in the other class, however,
has syntactic properties of a real noun phrase. It has a grammatical
function and is able to control at least some of the syntactic processes
that other overt subject noun phrases can control.  Expressions belonging
to the first class involve natural forces (thunder, lightning,
earthquakes, floods; diseases; and unusual mental states) while those
belonging to the second involve the more gradual change in state that we
have dubbed natural process. (1) is an instance of a natural force
expression;  (2), of a natural process.  We now examine three syntactic
properties which distinguish the null elements in the first class from
those in the second. <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black">I. Subject agreement. The finite
verb in the preterite and perfect tenses agrees in gender and number with
the subject of intransitives and with the object of transitives.  But in
other tenses agreement is always with the subject, be the verb
intransitive or be it transitive.  In the future the finite verb in
natural force expressions shows concord not with the null element, but
with the other core noun phrase. Thus, in (9) the future tense verb form
<i> karan </i> is in the plural to show agreement with the noun phrase
vuzimali 'strokes': <br />

	(9) vuzimali kar-an (obur-as) <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> strokes.fpl do-Fut.3pl cloud-Dat
<br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> 'There will be lightning (in the
cloud).' <br />

In the class of natural process expressions, however, it is the null
element (and not the overt noun phrase) that controls subject concord. In
(10) the future tense verb form kaDyi is in the singular, agreeing with
the null element, not with the overt noun phrase <i> taarakh </i> 'stars': 
<br />

   (10) taarakh kaD-yi (nab-as) neny <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> stars.mpl draw-Fut.3sg sky-Dat
clear.mpl <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> 'The stars will come out bright
(in the sky).' <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black">II. In Kashmiri there is a person
hierarchy such that, in non-ergative tenses (present and past duratives,
future, counter-to-fact), a direct object that is [+human] and [+specific]
is marked with the dative case if the subject is a third person. If the
subject is first person then a [+human, +specific] object is marked with
the nominative case and is cross-referenced on the verb with an object
suffix. (fn 1) <br />

   (11) su sooz-yi-y tsye jom <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> he send-Fut.3sg-2sgDat you.Dat
Jammu <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> 'He'll send you to Jammu.' <br />

   (12) bi sooz-a-th tsi jom <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> I send-Fut.1sg-2sgObj you.Nom
Jammu <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> 'I'll send you to Jammu.' <br />

In a preterite (or perfect) tense the object must be in the nominative (=
absolutive) case and, if it is a second person, it must be
cross-referenced with a nominative suffix on the finite verb: <br />

   (13) temy suuzu-kh tsi jom <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> he.Erg sent-2sgNom you.Nom Jammu
<br /> 

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> 'He sent you to Jammu.' <br />

Thus, in Kashmiri there is a very specific and constrained pattern of case
alternations for the objects of transitive verbs.  And for transitive
predicates to have objects that show these alternations, they must also
have subjects, because the choice of the case and the choice of the suffix
for the object depends on the person of the subject. <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black">This kind of alternation is not
found with natural force expressions. But if we examine a natural process
expression we discover that the overt core noun phrase associated with it
receives the cases and suffixes which one would expect it to receive if
one assumes the null element to be a third person subject and the overt
noun phrase to be an object.  In the future tense if the overt core noun
phrase of a natural process expression is second person, it gets the
dative case: <br />

   (14) vakhit-i brOOTh buDir-aav-yi-y tsye <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> time-Abl before
age-Tr-Fut.3sg-2sg.Dat you.Dat <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> 'You will age before your time!'
<br />

And in the preterite tense the overt core noun phrase of natural process
expressions gets the nominative (=absolutive) case: <br />

   (15) vakhit-i brOOh buDir-oovu-n-akh tsi <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> time-Abl before
age-Tr.Pst-3sg.Erg-2sg.Nom you.Nom <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> 'You aged before your time!'
[compare (14)] <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black">III. Further evidence for the
distinction of natural force and natural process expressions is to be
observed in their behavior in coordinate conjunctions.  Weather
expressions, which are syntactically intransi-tive, allow the conjunction
of forms having dummy agents with ordinary monovalent forms.  Although <i>
vuzimali </i> 'lightning strokes' in (16) is lexically the patient of the
verb <i> kar </i> 'do, make', it is syntactically the subject of its
clause and as such can be interpreted as the sub-ject of a following
clause (<i> ti pati geyas kam </i> 'and then became less'). <br />
 
  (16) gwaDi karyi-n-as syeThaa vuzimali ti pati gey-as kam <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> first did-3sE-3sD many strokes
and then went-3sD less <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> 'At first there was a lot of
lightning and then less.' <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black">In contrast, bivalent natural
process verbs allow conjunction only with other bivalent natural process
verbs.  In (17) and (18) the noun phrase <i> taarakh </i> 'stars' is also
lexically the patient of its verb <i> geeb kar </i> 'make disappear', but
in (18) since it is syntactically the direct object (not the subject) of
its clause it cannot be interpreted as the subject of the following clause
(<i> ti pati draayas byeyi neny </i> 'and then came out bright again').
<br />

   (17) gwaDi keryi-n-as taarakh geeb ti pati keDyi-n-as byeyi neny <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> first did-3sE-3sD stars hidden
and then drew-3sE-3sD again clear <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> 'First the stars disappeared and
then came out bright again.' <br />

   (18) *gwaDi keryi-n-as taarakh geeb ti pati draay-as byeyi neny <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> first did-3sE-3sD stars hidden
and then emerged-3sD again clear <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> 'First the stars disappeared and
then came out bright again.' <br />

In order to make a coordinate conjunction with an intransitive clause as
second member, one must select the intransitive counterpart of the natural
process expression: <br />
 
  (19) gwaDi gey-as taarakh geeb ti pati draay-as byeyi neny <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> first went-3sD stars hidden and
then emerged-3sD again clear <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black"> 'First the stars disappeared and
then came out bright again.' <br />

<font color="white">....<font color="black">Conclusion.  In this paper we have
presented three kinds of evidence for imputing the grammatical function of
subject to the null element in one class of impersonal expressions in
Kashmiri.  While similar kinds of evidence might be presented for imputing
subjecthood to dummy elements like <i> it </i> in English, <i> il </i> in
French, and <i> es </i> in German, it is also true that those elements are
not phonetically null; whereas the Kashmiri null subject is known only
through the presence of the cross-referencing pronominal suffix <i> -n
</i> that appears in preterite and perfect enses and through its syntactic
behavior. <br />

*. In the transcription system used for Kashmiri in this paper
reduplicating a symbol denotes (contrastive) length.  The letter i
represents a high (allophonically front or central) vowel, while e
represents a high (either front or central) vowel.  Palatalization is
uniformly indicated with the letter <i> y </i> (<i> j, ch, c </i> and <i>
sh </i> are inherently palatalized). The digraph <i> ts </i> is a dental
affricate. <br />

1. For a general overview of the pronominal suffixing systems of Kashmiri,
see Grierson 1973, and Hook and Koul 1984.  In this paper what are termed
&quot;nominative&quot; (=N) pronominal suffixes correspond to what we have termed
&quot;absolutive&quot; suffixes in our earlier papers and what we here call
&quot;ergative&quot; (=E) correspond to &quot;anti-absolutive&quot; there.  While there are
important conceptual differences informing these terminological ones, they
are not relevant to the present discussion. <br />
